            <p>
                The Sports Card Wheel Spin Tool is a user-friendly solution that streamlines the buyer and team tracking process for NBA, MLB, and 
                NFL sports card breaks. Simply enter the Whatnot live stream URL, and the tool will seamlessly extract data during the wheel spin. It 
                automatically matches the latest buyer with the team that lands on the wheel, ensuring accurate tracking for the selected sport. The 
                results are instantly displayed on a table, allowing sellers to view and track buyer-team pairings effortlessly. For added convenience, 
                sellers can export the data to an Excel sheet for further customization and easy printing.

            <p>
                The Sports Card Wheel Spin Tool was designed to revolutionize the buyer and team tracking process for sports card breakers on 
                Whatnot. While it excels in local environments, providing seamless tracking and data scraping capabilities, deployment on the 
                internet encountered challenges due to Cloudflare's restrictions on webscraping data from Whatnot. Despite this, the tool continues 
                to be a valuable asset, enhancing the sports card breaking experience with its efficient and accurate tracking capabilities.

            <h1>What is <span class="half-highlight">Sports Card Break?</span> </h1>
            <p>
                In sports card breaks, individuals or businesses buy entire boxes of sports cards and then offer collectors the chance to buy in and 
                claim cards from specific teams within the box. The breaker, who purchased the box, opens it via live stream to reveal the cards 
                inside. Participants who bought a specific team get to keep the cards from that team. For instance, if a participant purchased the 
                Los Angeles Lakers and there are two Lakers cards in the box, they get to keep those cards. However, participants who bought teams 
                without any cards receive nothing from the break.
