            <p>
                The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly tool for <span class="half-highlight-h"><a href="https://www.whatnot.com/">Whatnot</a></span> sellers in the world of <span class="half-highlight-h"><a href="#def-container">sports card breaks</a></span>. It is intended to save 
                sellers time and effort by automating the tracking of buyers and their corresponding teams. This automated tool takes care of data 
                entry, so sellers can focus on what matters most â€“ delivering a seamless experience to the buyers. No more worries about errors or 
                mix-ups, as the tool ensures accurate and reliable tracking between the buyers and teams.

            <h1>What is Sports Card Break? </h1>
            <p>
                In sports card breaks, individuals or businesses buy entire boxes of sports cards and then offer collectors the chance to "buy in" and 
                claim cards from specific teams within the box. The "breaker," who purchased the box, opens it via live stream to reveal the cards 
                inside. Participants who bought a specific team get to keep the cards from that team. For instance, if a participant purchased the 
                Los Angeles Lakers and there are two Lakers cards in the box, they get to keep those cards. However, participants who bought teams 
                without any cards receive nothing from the break.
